# Universal Grid

The UniversalGrid is a stand-alone library for managing objects within a grid-like layout.

I wrote this library after the need arose on numerous occations for a simple, light-weight grid for managing objects in this manner. Sometimes, grids are useful when 
creating simple WPF board games, in web applications for laying out tables and for many other applications.
